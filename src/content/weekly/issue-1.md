# Weekly Insight #1

This week has been about **new beginnings**.

## What I'm Reading

I've been revisiting *The Pragmatic Programmer*. It's a classic for a reason.

## What I'm Thinking

Simplicity is hard. It's easy to add features, but hard to take them away. This blog is an attempt at simplicity.

## Quote of the Week

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci
