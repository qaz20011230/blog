# What is Logic?

Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It allows us to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.

> "Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end." - Leonard Nimoy

## Key Concepts

1. **Premise**: A statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion.
2. **Conclusion**: The statement that is claimed to follow from the premises.
3. **Inference**: The process of deriving the conclusion from the premises.

## Why learn logic?

In a world full of noise, logic helps us think clearly and make better decisions.
